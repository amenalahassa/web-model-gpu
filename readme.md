## Web app to estimate the GPU resources needed for a deep learning model
This web app is a simple tool to estimate the GPU resources needed for a deep learning model. 
I will recommend the post [Deep Learning Hardware Guide](https://timdettmers.com/2020/09/07/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/) by Tim Dettmers for advanced users.
The guide provides a rough estimate of the GPU memory needed for a deep learning model based on the model size and the batch size.

### How to use the web app
Visit the web app [here](#).

### How it's built
I used Gradio to build the web app. Gradio is a Python library that allows you to create web interfaces for your machine learning models with just a few lines of code.
