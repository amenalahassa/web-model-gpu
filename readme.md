## Web app to estimate the GPU resources needed for a deep learning model
This web app is a simple tool to estimate the GPU resources needed for a deep learning model. 
I will recommend the post [Deep Learning Hardware Guide](https://timdettmers.com/2020/09/07/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/) by Tim Dettmers for advanced users.

### How to use the web app
Visit the web app [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/konradhugging/model-gpu-estimator).

### How it's built
I used Gradio to build the web app. Gradio is a Python library that allows you to create web interfaces for your machine learning models with just a few lines of code.

### How to run the code
You can run the code locally by cloning the repository and running the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
